### Nutrivigna 
The *[Nutrivigna](http://www.nutrivigna.it)* project, aimed to improve the nutrient efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of wine production, through the development and dissemination of different tools:
* innovative techniques of spectral observation from proximity (optical sensors mounted on operating machines) and from remote (drones and earth observation satellites) for the determination of mineral requirements;
* advanced web services for the nutritional balance integrated with procedures for "mapping" the areas of the vineyard with different nutritional needs;
* definition of vineyard management systems with low environmental impact.
