Here is a list of the projects that I've participated in recent years:

### Agro.Big.Data.Science
The *[agro.big.data.science](http://agrobigdatascience.it/)* project intends to apply the data driven logic to 3 production chains (kiwi, pear and spinach), complete with the necessary sensors for real-time data collection.

### FarmCO2Sink
The EU-funded *[FarmCO2Sink](https://farmco2sink.crpa.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=19589)* project aims to identify, in agroforestry production systems of the Province of Piacenza, the most efficient conservation systems in terms of biological sequestration of C at farm level and the reduction of climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

### GRACE
The EU-funded *[GRACE](https://www.grace-bbi.eu/)* project demonstrates large-scale miscanthus and hemp production on land with low productivity, contaminated soil or which has been abandoned.

### Positive
The *[Positive](http://www.progettopositive.it)* project aims to make agronomic interest indices available on a regional scale from satellite images of the Copernicus project and to prepare an IT infrastructure that makes precision irrigation and fertigation usable throughout the region.

### Soipomi
The *[SOIPOMI](https://progetti.crpv.it/Home/ProjectDetail/60)* project aims to remotely monitor the fields, processing the satellite images of the European Space Agency, to give operators in the supply chain an innovative tool to improve the management of processing tomatoes in Northern Italy.
