I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Remote Sensing and Precision Agriculture at Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore and I am a member of the UCSC Fields Crop group, advised by Prof. Stefano Amaducci.
My research field is at the interface between GIS science and remote sensing for precision agriculture applications. My main interests are related to high resolution multispectral/thermal UAV remote sensing to estimate biochemical and biophysical crop parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, biomass, and yield, through machine learning analysis and inversion of the canopy radiative transfer models.
